#Authenticate a Node.js API with JSON Web Tokens

Source: <https://scotch.io/tutorials/authenticate-a-node-js-api-with-json-web-tokens>

This repository is my take at this tutorial, with some enhancements in:

- code structure
- user creation
- security

This shouldn't be taken as a howto and I won't offer any official support (always happy to answer questions though). But lost in the middle of tutorials about user authentication for REST APIs, I decided to start somewhere and get my own take at it. If I have the time, I'll probably write an article explaining what I did there. In the meantime...

I hope this helps,
